This is pertaining the ML code written for Credit Card product purchase by a customer or not. This was the Jobathon problem conducted by Analytics Vidhya during 28th to 30th May 2021. 
The test and train dataset were provided by Analytics Vidhya. The target column was "Is_Lead". 
The problem could be solved by multiple classifiers - Gradient Boost, XGBoost, Decision Tree Classifer, LGBM classifier etc. I was able to achieve 0.7985859369 ROC-AUC score using Gradient boosting algorithm and the coded EDA.
Fell free to use the dataset and code to research and improve further.
